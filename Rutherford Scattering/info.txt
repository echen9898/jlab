Each subfolder corresponds to one of the four analysis procedures. Rest of the data is contained externally.

1) Beam profile
    -> MCA spectra for each angle 
    -> process.py

2) Gold foil thickness 
    -> MCA spectra for each of the 3 gold foil thicknesses at 0 degrees (including a measurement with no foil in order to deduce bin associated with E0).
    -> process.py

3) Z dependence 
    -> MCA spectra for each element (Fe, Al, Ni, Au) at 0 degrees (20 as well perhaps)
    -> process.py

4) Cross section
    -> MCA spectra for 2 layer gold
    -> daily normalization data
    -> process.py
